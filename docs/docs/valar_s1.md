## 1. Download the App

The Android or iOS app is required. Please download using the links below

[For Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.blynk.appexport.morning_rod)

Before mounting any hardware, we need to test the connection and the device.

Open up the app, create an account, and log in.





## 2. Reset the WiFi

During manufacturing, WiFi credentials may have been stored in your device. You need to clear them out before you can connect.

Locate the WiFi rest button near the power plug. There are 2 buttons, so be sure to press the correct one.

The WiFi button is **opposite** of the USB plug.

### 3a. Initial Test

Before attaching the device to a window, we need to test the motor. 

To select a device, find it on the main page and touch it to open.

Set up the following values to run a test. 

    1. "OPEN STALL" set to 63
    2. "CLOSE STALL" set to 63
    3. "CLOSE CURRENT SETTING" set to 10
    4. "OPEN CURRENT SETTING" set to 10
    5. "SPEED" set to 100
    6. "Max Distance" set to 12

Press OPEN and then CLOSE to test



### 4. Attach the String

We will now attached the string to both wall bracket hooks. 

First, decide which side you will attach the motor to and at what height. 

You can attach the motor on either the left or the right side of the window. In addition, you can attach it so the front is facing either the left or the right side as well. That gives you 4 options to choose from.

I recommend you install it with the face (where the motor gear is), facing away from the window. This way it remains well hidden behind the curtain.

After deciding on the side, decide the approximate height. You can attach it on the floor, or up near the rod. I prefer something in the middle where the buttons are easy to reach. 

Now that you know where it will go, let's attach the strings. 

Begin by preparing the curtains. Place both curtains onto your curtain rod.

(Insert Photo of window)

Now let's prepare the string.

The simplest thing to do is to lay the string, pulleys, and back tab mounts on the floor, make sure they are assembled correctly, then attach them to the hooks.

Place the pulley on the floor, on the **opposite** end of the motor. (#1)

![Curtain1](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0048/6244/3590/files/String_Setup_1.jpg?v=1611796641)



Place the back tab mounts on the floor, in the center. Make sure to orient them in opposite directions. This will allow the string to pass through them correctly. Undo the screws if they are all the way in. The part with 2 screws will hold the ends of the string. The part with 1 screw will have the string pass through it. See below:

Now place the double pulley on the opposite end of the single pulley, on the same side as the motor. 

Take the string and put it through both sides of the single single pulley.

(Need more instructions) 



Now we are ready to attach everything to the wall brackets. 

Take a zip tie and place it through the single pulley. Attach the zip tie to the bracket that is opposite of the motor.

Take another zip tie and attach it to the pulley that is on the same side as the motor
